# Hive-Projects
 This project sets up a local development environment for HDFS and Apache Hive, including a repository with guides for configuration and deployment. It features two mini projects: data ingestion and querying. Ideal for developers to integrate these technologies and gain hands-on experience in big data processing and analysis.
